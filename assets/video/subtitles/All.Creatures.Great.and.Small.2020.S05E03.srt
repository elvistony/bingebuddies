3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:09,920
It sounds like the carburettor.

4
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,000
Yes, I'm aware of that.

5
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
She's not cooperating.

6
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Try again tomorrow.

7
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:23,080
Can you give this to Audrey for me?

8
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,080
Is there any message?

9
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,080
She'll know what it's for.

10
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:37,480
Maggie asked me to give you this.

11
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:40,080
Oh, thank you.

12
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:44,280
Aren't you going to open it?

13
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,040
I'll do it later.

14
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,120
Ingredients have been on the ground and I've a christening cake once icing.

15
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,480
Is Mr. Bosworth aware of these clandestine dealings?

16
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:56,360
I can assure you everything is strictly above board.

17
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,560
Just called in a favour, that's all.

18
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,360
Someone's traipsed mud all through the hallway.

19
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,360
Swept it twice today.

20
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,360
Here, let me do it.

21
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,360
You've got cake to make.

22
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:08,200
I might retire to my office before someone tidies me away.

23
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:17,160
I'll be working on my speech if anyone needs me.

24
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:24,760
Oh, your parents not with you?

25
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,440
They're just getting settled at the B&B in there.

26
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,440
I'll bring them over.

27
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,440
Oh.

28
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,440
You don't see me going to all this trouble for your dad, do you?

29
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,440
Oh, that's different.

30
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,800
I hardly ever see him.

31
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,520
I'm just the girl that dragged you away from Glasgow.

32
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,520
Corrupted me.

33
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,520
Lured me to the dark side.

34
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:42,520
I bet they were excited to see you.

35
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,360
They're not interested in me.

36
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,280
You and Jimmy, they've come to see you.

37
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:49,640
Oh, talk of his lordship.

38
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,640
Did you tell Siegfried he could write a speech?

39
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:54,640
He said it was part of his godparent duties.

40
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,640
I'll talk to him.

41
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,640
And say what?

42
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,640
Tell him to keep it brief.

43
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,640
It's Siegfried we're talking about.

44
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,640
Come in.

45
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,640
Come in.

46
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,640
He's still not back from his exams.

47
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,640
Yes, yes.

48
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:16,760
Darragh, B-2 to 9-7.

49
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:19,040
Mr. Biggins.

50
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,480
How's that nanny goat doing?

51
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,480
Really?

52
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,360
We should have seen a marked improvement by now.

53
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,320
Yes, I understand.

54
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,680
I'll be with you as soon as I can.

55
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,680
Problem?

56
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,720
He's got a lumpy jaw.

57
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,720
He's had me up there twice already.

58
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:37,120
You'll have to go for me, I'm afraid.

59
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,120
Why?

60
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:41,240
Because I'm likely to end up doing a stretch in Wormwood Scrubs if I have to spend another

61
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,400
second in that man's company.

62
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,680
If it was any other time, Siegfried, but with my parents.

63
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:48,680
Well, that's a convenient excuse, don't you think?

64
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:53,680
Everything all right?

65
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,680
Biggins.

66
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:57,680
Has he mentioned the gates yet?

67
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,680
You know he's got seven gates?

68
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,680
Seven?

69
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,680
He's going after each of the deadly sins, no doubt.

70
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:06,680
He's run me ragged with his constant vacillation, but not this time.

71
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:11,680
I meant to ask, how are you getting along with the speech for the christening?

72
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,680
Oh, I'm rather pleased with it, actually.

73
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:18,680
And how long is it exactly?

74
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,680
This is the beginning of Jimmy's spiritual journey, James.

75
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:26,680
I take my role as godparent very serious.

76
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,680
As do I.

77
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,680
But I shan't be doing a speech.

78
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:33,680
And for that we'll be eternally grateful.

79
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,680
Right, I shall fetch my parents.

80
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,680
They're champing at the bit to see Jimmy.

81
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:53,680
Abandon all hope ye who enter here.

82
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,680
Can I help you?

83
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:21,680
Telegram for Mr Farnon.

84
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,680
But Mr Farnon?

85
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,680
Is that them?

86
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,680
No, you're all right.

87
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,680
Oh!

88
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:22,680
You want to get that carburetor seen to?

89
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,680
I see you still haven't got round to fixing that gate.

90
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:27,680
Helps keep undesirables out.

91
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,680
As opposed to keeping them in.

92
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,680
I think you better take me straight to your goat, Mr Biggins.

93
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,680
Does this mean I'll get my money back?

94
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,680
On account of you misdiagnosing, like?

95
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,680
I'm perfectly confident in my diagnosis.

96
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:42,680
It's funny how it always ends up with me having to part with my hard-earned cash.

97
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,680
All right.

98
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,680
All right, all right.

99
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:02,680
Are you absolutely sure you administered the sulfanilamide as prescribed?

100
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,680
Aye.

101
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,680
Exactly as you said.

102
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,680
Then we'll need to increase the dose.

103
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:11,680
Sounds expensive.

104
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,680
Would you get her some fresh straw, please?

105
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,680
She'll need somewhere comfortable to sleep.

106
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,680
Oh, David.

107
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:21,680
Don't worry, old thing.

108
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,680
Soon I'll have you grazing again.

109
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:27,680
Soon I'll have you grazing again.

110
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,680
There we are.

111
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:35,680
Oh, come and give your granny a big hug.

112
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,680
It's lovely to see you both.

113
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:42,680
He's gotten so big since we last saw him.

114
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,680
Aye, he's a bonnie wee thing.

115
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,680
He's a bit grisly tonight.

116
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,680
Teething a bit.

117
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,680
It's too early for that.

118
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,680
He'll be wanting a feed, poor mate.

119
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,680
If I give him any more milk, he'll burst.

120
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,680
Nonsense, he's a growing boy.

121
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,680
He's like you, son. He's got a big appetite.

122
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:05,680
Does your mummy not feed you?

123
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,680
A perfect timing, Mrs H.

124
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,680
Mr and Mrs Harriet.

125
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,680
I trust you had a pleasant journey?

126
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,680
Aye, no complaints.

127
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,680
Need a hand?

128
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,680
What time is the christening tomorrow?

129
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,680
The midday.

130
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,680
Oh, I can't wait.

131
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,680
Is everything all right, Audrey?

132
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,680
Course.

133
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:34,680
The scones are fresh out the oven.

134
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:35,680
Tea?

135
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:39,680
Yes, please.

136
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,680
It's lovely.

137
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,680
It's very tasty.

138
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:46,680
You want to hold on to this one, son?

139
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,680
Oh, I can't take the credit, I'm afraid.

140
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,680
It's all Audrey's handiwork.

141
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,680
The flowers are all down to Helen.

142
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,680
Picked them fresh for you this morning.

143
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,680
What's that there?

144
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,680
Stimulant injection.

145
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:09,680
Won't give her the boost she needs.

146
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,680
Nay, she just needs some iodine.

147
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:13,680
We've been through this, Mr Biggins.

148
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,680
Iodine is of no use to your goat.

149
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,680
Yeah, you and your newfangled powders.

150
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,680
Some kind of commission, are you?

151
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,680
I wouldn't be a competent veterinary surgeon

152
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:23,680
if I prescribed something as antiquated as iodine.

153
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,680
Expensive things, them injections.

154
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,680
How much is that going to cost me?

155
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,680
I honestly don't know.

156
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,680
Oh, you'll know, all right, when you get a pen in your hand.

157
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,680
Send me that big bill, won't you?

158
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,680
All right, all right.

159
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,680
There we are.

160
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,680
Right, all we can do now is pray.

161
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:45,680
You going to charge me for that as well?

162
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,680
Take this, and if it doesn't work, I won't charge you.

163
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,680
How does that sound?

164
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:53,680
Oh, I suppose.

165
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,680
Now, perhaps you'd be so good as to help me with the gate.

166
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,680
You're joking, aren't you?

167
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,680
Bloody thing's a death trap.

168
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:06,680
My mother swore blind by Mrs Winslow's soothing syrup.

169
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:09,680
Later proven to contain dangerous levels of morphine.

170
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,680
Oh.

171
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:15,680
One last kiss from Granny before we go.

172
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,680
He's looking tired.

173
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,680
Oh, don't let that face fool you.

174
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,680
He'll have us up till the early hours.

175
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,680
Routine's the key.

176
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,680
James used to go down like clockwork.

177
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:27,680
Not so much as a peep out of him until morning.

178
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,680
Don't listen to her.

179
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:31,680
If I set her lungs on him, it could wake the dead.

180
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,680
Why don't you come round after breakfast?

181
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,680
We'll take Jimmy for a walk round Derby.

182
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,680
I would like that.

183
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,680
Good night, son.

184
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,680
Good night.

185
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,680
See you tomorrow.

186
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:45,680
Good night.

187
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,680
Night.

188
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,680
That wasn't so bad, was it?

189
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:09,680
Ah.

190
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,680
How are Mr Biggins?

191
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,680
Insufferable, as ever.

192
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,680
All I want to do is pour myself a whisky and lie in a hot bath.

193
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,680
Mr Farnham...

194
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,680
Are we still playing host to the Scottish contingent?

195
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,680
A telegram arrived.

196
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,680
It's addressed to you.

197
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,680
I see.

198
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:32,680
James and Ellen are putting Jimmy to bed so you won't be disturbed.

199
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:36,680
Thank you, Mrs Hall.

200
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,680
Good night.

201
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,680
He's coming home.

202
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,680
What is it? Is he here?

203
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,680
Home tomorrow.

204
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,680
Is that it?

205
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,680
Well, Tristan's never been one for detail.

206
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,680
When is he back?

207
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,680
Your guess is as good as mine.

208
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,680
If you're looking for hidden meaning, I wouldn't bother.

209
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,680
Right, I've checked the train timetable.

210
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,680
There's only that one connection from London he could be on today.

211
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:09,680
Right.

212
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,680
It's got to be a good sign if he was able to send it himself.

213
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,680
Yes, I suppose so.

214
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,680
Well, perhaps he's just got a few days' leave.

215
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:20,680
From Cairo?

216
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:23,680
Well, it's just like Tristan Shaw, because we're about to throw a party.

217
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,680
Well, I hope you're right.

218
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,680
I don't imagine you got much sleep.

219
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,680
It was a frightful night.

220
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,680
Well, try not to assume the worst.

221
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,680
It's easier said than done.

222
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,680
It's easier said than done.

223
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,680
It was the same when he was a child.

224
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:59,680
Falling out of trees, riding his bicycle without brakes.

225
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,680
Never thought for his own safety.

226
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,680
He's resilient. Always has been.

227
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,680
Where are my plastic... Oh, thank you.

228
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,680
Would you like me to come with you?

229
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,680
I think it best I do this by myself.

230
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:19,680
I will never utter a crossword to that boy again if he comes home in one piece.

231
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,680
Oh, not today.

232
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,680
Not today!

233
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,680
Not today.

234
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:04,680
Come on!

235
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,680
Not now!

236
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,680
Not now!

237
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,680
Not now!

238
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,680
To be early is to be on time.

239
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,680
To be on time is to be late.

240
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:13,680
And to be late is unacceptable.

241
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,680
You drummed that into me enough times.

242
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,680
Aren't you going to say something?

243
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,680
Can I help you?

244
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,680
Oh, I'm sorry.

245
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,680
I didn't realise the surgery was closed today.

246
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,680
Oh, I'm sure my son can help you.

247
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,680
He's a partner here.

248
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,680
James Herriot, MRCVS.

249
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:01,680
Graduated top of his class at Glasgow University.

250
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,680
Oh, I don't like to interrupt him.

251
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,680
Oh, nonsense. He'll be glad to help.

252
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,680
Shall we?

253
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,680
Oh.

254
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,680
Just don't talk to them about football.

255
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,680
Or Mrs Winslow's soothing syrup.

256
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,680
Morning.

257
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,680
We're almost ready to go.

258
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,680
Morning.

259
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,680
James.

260
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,680
Making friends, is he?

261
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,680
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr Herriot.

262
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,680
Your mother insisted.

263
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,680
It happened.

264
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,680
It happened.

265
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,680
It happened.

266
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,680
It happened.

267
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,680
It happened.

268
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,680
It happened.

269
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,680
It happened.

270
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,680
It happened.

271
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,680
It happened.

272
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,680
It happened.

273
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,680
She insisted.

274
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,680
The animals always come first.

275
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,680
Isn't that right, James?

276
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,680
Indeed it is.

277
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,680
Do you mind?

278
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,680
I'll have to catch you up.

279
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,680
No, of course not.

280
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,680
How about we start at the Victory Garden?

281
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,680
Great.

282
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,680
You can give me some tips for my radishes.

283
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,680
See you later, then.

284
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:57,680
Sorry.

285
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,680
And who do we have here, then?

286
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:03,680
This is Lucy.

287
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,680
She's a fine-looking dog.

288
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,680
Eh?

289
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,680
Yes.

290
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,680
Well, what seems to be the problem?

291
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,680
She's obsessed with Emmeline.

292
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,680
Emmeline?

293
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:22,680
It's got to the point where she won't leave home without her.

294
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,680
This is what she does.

295
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,680
Well, let's get her inside.

296
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,680
See if we can't get to the bottom of it.

297
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:38,680
Oh, erm...

298
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:43,680
OK.

299
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,680
All right.

300
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:56,680
Is that you, Mr Farnham?

301
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,680
Which one were you looking for?

302
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,680
Get over here.

303
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,680
I've been setting this up since Cairo.

304
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,680
Everything's intact.

305
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,680
No bones broken.

306
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,680
Not a hair out of place.

307
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:27,680
Well, go on. Tell her about your promotion.

308
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:30,680
He's only been put in charge of training new veterinary recruits in Doncaster.

309
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:33,680
No, it's just lecturing. Not all the training.

310
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,680
You know me, Mrs H.

311
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,680
Never one to boast about my achievements.

312
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,680
Is that for me?

313
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,680
Just a little treat. I've been serving for you.

314
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,680
Oh, life doesn't get any better.

315
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,680
Oh, is Jim here?

316
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,680
I think so.

317
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,680
James Herriot, get out here!

318
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:53,680
James!

319
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:59,680
I tried confiscating it, but she went and took a chunk out my hand.

320
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,680
And that's the first time she's ever turned like that.

321
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,680
Well, that wouldn't do at all.

322
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,680
See? That's what she does.

323
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:08,680
Well, you're lucky she didn't try and nip you, too.

324
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,680
James Herriot, get out here!

325
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,680
I think...

326
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,680
I think what we have here is a case of overstimulation.

327
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,680
Is it serious?

328
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,680
Well, that's nothing to worry about.

329
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:21,680
While toys can be great for dogs, sometimes they can form unhealthy attachments.

330
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,680
So what do you suggest?

331
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:28,680
Well, I think a period of enforced separation might be in order.

332
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,680
Well, she won't like that at all.

333
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:31,680
Don't worry.

334
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,680
Annaline's just going on a little adventure.

335
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,680
Keep her distracted with plenty of walks.

336
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,680
Maybe they'll treat her, too.

337
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:47,680
Pop back in a couple of days and we'll see how she's getting on.

338
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,680
Yes, I will do. Thank you, Mr Herriot.

339
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,680
Mind it you go, Lucy.

340
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,680
Here you are.

341
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:59,680
What's all this I hear about Jimmy stealing my thunder?

342
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,680
What's all this groaning on your top lip?

343
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,680
So?

344
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,680
How are you?

345
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,680
Exhausted.

346
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:16,680
Never met so many hardened drinkers in all my life.

347
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:17,680
You back for good?

348
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:20,680
I'm in Doncaster three days a week until I'm redeployed.

349
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,680
That's still Yorkshire.

350
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,680
Just.

351
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:24,680
Just.

352
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,680
The rest of the time is my own. I'm a man of leisure.

353
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:29,680
Excellent. We could do with another pair of hands.

354
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:33,680
Last time I checked, I actually don't work for you anymore.

355
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,680
Yes, quite right. My mistake.

356
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,680
Let me grab these for you.

357
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:41,680
Yes, good. You can fill me in on what's been happening around here.

358
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,680
That's exactly as you left it.

359
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,680
With the addition of wee Jimmy, of course.

360
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:48,680
That's not good enough. I want salacious scandal. Come on.

361
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,680
So what did they have you doing out there?

362
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:53,680
Field support, mainly.

363
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:56,680
Making sure the animals were fit for duty.

364
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,680
Horses, mules, the odd camel.

365
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,680
The unsung heroes, eh?

366
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,680
It would appear we have an interloper.

367
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,680
That's Hamish.

368
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:13,680
With very questionable taste in bow ties.

369
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,680
That would be Carmody.

370
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,680
He's in London finishing off his final exams.

371
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,680
Be back in a week or two.

372
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,680
The Pretender to my throne.

373
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,680
I can't wait to meet him.

374
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,680
Did Siegfried not mention him in his letters?

375
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:25,680
No, he told me he'd hired a new assistant.

376
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:28,680
He neglected to tell me he was now sleeping in my bed.

377
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:31,680
Tristan, there's someone who wants to meet you.

378
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,680
I think he was just grateful for the distraction.

379
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,680
He's missed you.

380
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,680
We all have.

381
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,680
I'll leave you to it, shall I?

382
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,680
How was the walk?

383
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,680
Oh, we had a smashing time.

384
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:00,680
Fresh air's the key.

385
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:03,680
You loved having his pram pushed by his granny, didn't you?

386
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,680
Eh?

387
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:05,680
And the Victory Garden.

388
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,680
Oh, lovely.

389
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,680
Yes, I wonder how she found the time.

390
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,680
With wee Jimmy to care for.

391
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:13,680
Where were you?

392
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,680
I got caught up in something here.

393
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,680
I don't believe it.

394
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:23,680
This isn't a mirage, Helen.

395
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,680
It really is me.

396
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:27,680
Older, wiser, more handsome than ever.

397
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,680
Mr and Mrs Heriot.

398
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:31,680
You're looking younger by the day.

399
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,680
It's lovely to see you.

400
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,680
Hi.

401
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:35,680
Back where you belong.

402
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,680
And this is young Jimmy, I take it?

403
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,680
He's excited to meet his Uncle Tristan.

404
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,680
May I?

405
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:51,680
Hello.

406
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,680
Are you waiting for him to reply?

407
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,680
No.

408
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,680
I'm just trying to work out who he looks like.

409
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,680
Well, he's a handsome young thing.

410
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,680
So I'm guessing he's got his mother's genes.

411
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:08,680
Sorry to break up the party, but we're due at the church soon.

412
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,680
Is it that time already?

413
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,680
I need to get Jimmy his gown.

414
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:13,680
Oh, don't you worry.

415
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:15,680
We'll keep the becker talking.

416
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,680
Are you sure you're not too tired from your journey?

417
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,680
What?

418
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:21,680
Miss you, renounce the devil?

419
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:22,680
Not a chance.

420
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,680
Sacred occasion, Tristan.

421
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,680
That doesn't mean we can't have a bit of fun.

422
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,680
Shall we?

423
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:29,680
Let's go.

424
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:53,680
Dearly beloved, you have brought the child here today to be baptised.

425
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:58,680
That our Lord Jesus Christ would receive him and release him from sin.

426
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:02,680
To sanctify him with the Holy Ghost.

427
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:07,680
To give him the kingdom of heaven and everlasting life.

428
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:11,680
Now, can I please ask the family to gather at the font?

429
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,680
Did they throw you out?

430
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,680
It was quite the scandal.

431
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,680
How many times did you fall in love?

432
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:31,680
Oh, just once, Layla.

433
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,680
My Arabian camel.

434
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,680
She was exotic, feisty.

435
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:36,680
She did have a tendency to get the hamper.

436
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,680
Tristan.

437
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:38,680
Sorry, Vicar.

438
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,680
Could I ask the godparents to step forward?

439
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:49,680
Do thou, in the name of this child, renounce the devil?

440
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:55,680
Do thou, in the name of this child, renounce the devil and all of his works?

441
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,680
I renounce them all.

442
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:02,680
Will you then obediently keep God's holy will and the commandments

443
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:05,680
and walk in the same all the days of thy life?

444
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,680
I will, by God's help.

445
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,680
Would one of the godparents take Jimmy?

446
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,680
Layla.

447
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,680
Layla.

448
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,680
Almighty ever-living God,

449
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:25,680
sanctify this water to the mystical washing away of sin.

450
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:30,680
Grant that this child receives the fullness of thy grace.

451
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:33,680
Through Jesus Christ, our Lord. Amen.

452
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,680
Amen.

453
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:36,680
Would you please name the child?

454
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,680
James Alexander.

455
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:40,680
Right, young man?

456
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:42,680
It's your turn.

457
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:51,680
Is he good with water?

458
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,680
Only if there's ducks.

459
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:59,680
I baptize thee in the name of the Father,

460
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:02,680
the Son,

461
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:05,680
and the Holy Ghost.

462
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:07,680
Amen.

463
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:08,680
Amen.

464
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,680
Amen.

465
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,680
I thought that went rather well.

466
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,680
Mrs. Hall will need some time to prepare the lunch,

467
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,680
and then we can move on to the speeches.

468
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,680
There's more than one?

469
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,680
I was talking figuratively, James.

470
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,680
Hang on, hang on.

471
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,680
Isn't it customary to wet the baby's head?

472
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,680
That's the night the baby's born, not just after the christening.

473
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:30,680
Well, I missed the birth on account of me fighting for my country.

474
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,680
I don't think it's appropriate, not today.

475
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:34,680
Don't you want to buy your brother a pint?

476
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,680
You've been away fighting a war.

477
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,680
Of course I do, but there's a schedule to stick to.

478
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:39,680
Another hour ain't going to work.

479
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:41,680
I'll have lunch ready for when you get back.

480
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:43,680
Right, that's settled then.

481
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:44,680
James, you coming for one?

482
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:45,680
One.

483
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:47,680
Mum, I want to get back to the house.

484
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,680
Another time.

485
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,680
You go with Tristan.

486
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:50,680
I'll take your mum back.

487
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:51,680
That's very kind of you.

488
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:53,680
Are you sure?

489
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,680
Just don't let him lead you astray.

490
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,680
I'll be an hour tops.

491
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,680
I'm so sorry, Helen.

492
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:01,680
I'm sure Tristan didn't mean to commandeer your day.

493
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,680
Right, let's make a start on this spread.

494
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,680
Actually, I'd rather go with James and Tristan.

495
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,680
And when we're still an adult, I can do what I like.

496
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,680
I don't like it. It shouldn't be in a bar.

497
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:20,680
Absolutely not.

498
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:21,680
Tris, what are you having?

499
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:22,680
I'll put your money away, James.

500
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:23,680
This round's on me.

501
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,680
Five pints of your finest, please, barmaid.

502
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:27,680
Oh, make that six.

503
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,680
Look at what the cat's dragged in.

504
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:29,680
Egypt's finest export.

505
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,680
I see the war's done nothing to dampen your spirit.

506
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:34,680
How have you been?

507
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:36,680
Surviving.

508
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:37,680
Just about.

509
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,680
Any word from Arthur?

510
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:41,680
They've got him stationed out in North Africa.

511
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:43,680
Libya, I think it was.

512
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,680
Well, it's a shame our paths never crossed.

513
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,680
We could have pined together over...

514
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:50,680
...Darabee.

515
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,680
Enemy sighted at three o'clock.

516
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:54,680
I'm afraid so.

517
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:55,680
Enemy...

518
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:57,680
Enemy sighted at three o'clock.

519
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:00,680
Oh, is that Biggins?

520
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:02,680
He's like the Grim Reaper.

521
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:04,680
Lurking round every corner.

522
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,680
Look, you've only got yourselves to blame.

523
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:09,680
You should have stopped taking that old rascal's business years ago.

524
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,680
Well, then.

525
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,680
Where is it you were stationed? Cairo, was it?

526
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,680
Indeed.

527
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,680
Yeah, it was a scene of much heartbreak for many of us.

528
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,680
Aye.

529
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:21,680
Lost a lot of men.

530
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:23,680
I'm talking about the women.

531
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,680
It can't have been easy, though.

532
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,680
Working in that heat.

533
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:29,680
That was exhausting.

534
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:30,680
Yeah, deadly at times.

535
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:32,680
How did you get through it?

536
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:34,680
The Cairo cafe, mainly.

537
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,680
Sometimes the turf club, depending on, you know, my mood.

538
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,680
Come on, you must have seen some hardship out there.

539
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,680
You know me, James.

540
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,680
Never want to let a little bloodshed get me down.

541
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,680
Well, that'll be six shillings.

542
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:49,680
Exactly.

543
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,680
Tristan?

544
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,680
Would you mind? I've left my wallet in my other trousers.

545
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,680
There you go.

546
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,680
Can I help at all?

547
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:10,680
Oh, no, you're all right.

548
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,680
We're nearly done now.

549
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:21,680
Well, that was a lovely service.

550
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,680
Oh, thank you.

551
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:25,680
Jimmy enjoyed it.

552
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:27,680
Do you want a brew?

553
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:28,680
Oh, no, no, you carry on as you are.

554
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,680
I'm happy just sitting here.

555
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,680
So this is where you eat all your meals?

556
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:38,680
Most of the time, yes.

557
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:40,680
That makes sense.

558
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,680
You don't want to stay cooked up in that cramped attic.

559
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:47,680
Oh, Jimmy's awake.

560
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,680
Oh, shall I get him?

561
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:50,680
Don't worry, I'll go.

562
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:03,680
Hello.

563
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,680
Yes.

564
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:06,680
Yes.

565
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:08,680
Where should I put these?

566
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,680
Oh, on the table's fine.

567
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:12,680
Did you hear that?

568
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,680
Sounded like scratching.

569
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,680
Did you hear that?

570
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:20,680
Did you hear that?

571
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:22,680
Did you?

572
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,680
Did you?

573
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,680
Oh, what are you doing here on your own?

574
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:29,680
I need some help here.

575
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,680
Oh.

576
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:32,680
Oh.

577
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:33,680
Oh.

578
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:34,680
Oh.

579
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:35,680
Oh.

580
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,680
Oh.

581
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:37,680
Oh.

582
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:38,680
Oh.

583
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:39,680
Oh.

584
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,680
Clawed at the door, she was.

585
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:44,680
Her name was Rosa.

586
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:47,680
She was a Canadian, stationed at the field hospital.

587
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:48,680
She were a looker.

588
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,680
We're talking Betty Grable here.

589
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:51,680
Legs that went on mine.

590
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,680
What happened to her?

591
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,680
Her heart laid with another.

592
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,680
Royal engineer from Cleethorpes.

593
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,680
God's sake, it's hardly a farewell to arms.

594
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:04,680
Just out of interest, did you do any work over there, Tristan?

595
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:06,680
Excellent question.

596
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:08,680
I did my fair share.

597
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,680
There was a capture of Sidi Barani, for one.

598
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:11,680
Why?

599
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:12,680
Big lad, was he?

600
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:14,680
It's on the Egypt-Libya border.

601
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:16,680
You were part of that campaign.

602
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:18,680
A small part, yes.

603
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:19,680
How exactly?

604
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:21,680
Because from what I can gather,

605
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:23,680
you spent your time drifting from one bar to another.

606
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,680
A lot's changed since your day, Siegfried.

607
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:27,680
Is that so?

608
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,680
You lot relied on tin hats and blind faith.

609
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,680
Nowadays, we prefer a more strategic approach.

610
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:32,680
Isn't that right, James?

611
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:33,680
Absolutely.

612
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:34,680
I think you'll find...

613
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:35,680
Do you know what? Forget it.

614
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:38,680
If you'll excuse me, I need some air.

615
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,680
Mr Biggins!

616
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:44,680
How's your goat? Any improvement?

617
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:46,680
Well, she's got worse, if anything.

618
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:49,680
I'll be wanting my money back on that prescription of yours.

619
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,680
Are you sure you're administering it correctly?

620
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:54,680
You're saying I can't make out instructions, is that it?

621
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:55,680
I'm saying no such thing.

622
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,680
I just don't understand why it hasn't taken effect.

623
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:00,680
Because the stuff you gave me is bloody useless.

624
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:01,680
You hear this, Alderson?

625
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:05,680
Victory's only been after trying to power me off with some fake powders.

626
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,680
Fake powder sounds like my domain.

627
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:08,680
How can I be of assistance?

628
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:09,680
Everything's under control.

629
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:12,680
He's just slandered your name in a pub full of paying customers.

630
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,680
That's Peg, I feel sorry for.

631
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:17,680
Treating her like some kind of experiment.

632
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:18,680
Right, that's it.

633
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:19,680
I insist on having another look.

634
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,680
Hang on a minute.

635
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:21,680
There's no trouble at all.

636
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:22,680
Wait for me.

637
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:23,680
What are you doing?

638
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:24,680
I'm coming with you.

639
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:25,680
There's really no need.

640
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:26,680
What are you talking about?

641
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:27,680
He's besmirching our good name.

642
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:30,680
James, will you pass on my apologies to Mrs. Hall?

643
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:31,680
Aye, of course.

644
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:45,680
You know, I encountered my fair share of goats in Egypt.

645
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,680
There's a particular knack with them.

646
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:48,680
I could give you some points as...

647
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:52,680
You know, I encountered my fair share of goats in Egypt.

648
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:53,680
There's a particular knack with them.

649
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:54,680
I could give you some points as...

650
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:12,680
Keep still.

651
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:14,680
Why would she come back here?

652
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:16,680
I don't know, but she's after something.

653
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:20,680
What is it?

654
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:22,680
What are you looking for, eh?

655
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:25,680
Is she after food?

656
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:28,680
I don't think so.

657
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:39,680
What?

658
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:59,680
It's not this, is it?

659
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:12,920
All this for a tie?

660
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,640
What are the symptoms?

661
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:17,640
Difficulty eating, salivating.

662
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:23,640
Come on, let's have a little look at you.

663
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:31,640
Ah, yes. She has nodules in the jaw, swelling around the neck and face.

664
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:33,640
Has to be actinomycosis.

665
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:35,640
In English?

666
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:38,640
Lumpy jaw, Mr. Biggins.

667
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,640
Which was my original diagnosis.

668
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:47,640
Can I see the prescription I gave you yesterday?

669
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:48,640
What for?

670
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,640
Because I can't believe you've administered it correctly.

671
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,640
Are you calling me a liar?

672
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,640
He was merely asking for confirmation, Mr. Biggins.

673
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:58,640
All I want is my money back from those dodgy powders of yours.

674
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,640
You should count yourself lucky we're not in Egypt.

675
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:03,640
They'd have just slapped on some iodine and hoped for the best.

676
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:06,640
No, no, thankfully we're a little more advanced in our way of thinking here.

677
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,640
You bare-faced cheek of a...

678
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:09,640
Sorry?

679
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:11,640
You, making out I don't know what's best for me animals.

680
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:12,640
All I'm saying is that...

681
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,640
I think you've said more than enough already, don't you?

682
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:21,640
Could my brother use your stove to make up a warm compress?

683
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:23,640
It might help reduce Peg's swelling.

684
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:27,640
Ah, Aspall.

685
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,640
Now, where were we?

686
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:37,640
You slander in my good name.

687
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:38,640
Yes.

689
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,640
James told me stories about your dog.

690
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:53,640
He's done, isn't he? Aye.

691
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:56,640
James tears up every time he's mentioned.

692
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:59,640
You know, he still waits at the door for James to come home.

693
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:00,640
Oh.

694
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:02,640
We both do.

695
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:09,640
She's treating that toy like it's a baby.

696
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:11,640
Oh, I remember that feeling.

697
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,640
You never want to let go.

698
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,640
Gives me a pain in my chest just thinking about it.

699
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:24,640
You're doing a wonderful job.

700
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:25,640
You know that, don't you?

701
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,640
What is it?

702
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,640
I think her tits might be swollen.

What's Lucy doing here?

00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,640
We found her scratching at the door.

707
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,640
Turns out she left someone behind.

708
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,640
Emmeline?

709
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:59,640
I think it's more than just a toy to her, James.

710
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,640
I think it might be a phantom pregnancy.

Ellen's right.

714
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:34,640
Her mammary glands are definitely swollen.

715
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,640
So it is a phantom pregnancy.

00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,640
Oh, I'm impressed.

717
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:41,640
They get the idea they're going to have pups after they've been in season.

718
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:43,640
Some even get a swelling in the abdomen.

Oh, she just wanted to be with her pup.

00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:49,640
I can't believe you tried to take her baby, James.

721
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,640
She was being aggressive.

722
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:55,640
I did it for her own safety.

723
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:57,640
You locked her away in a drawer.

724
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:00,640
Maybe we shouldn't be too hard on the boy.

725
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:03,640

Tormenting one of his farmhands, probably.

00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:17,640
What happened to the compress?

730
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:19,640
I got a little distracted.

731
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:23,640
I can't believe he lied to my face.

732
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:25,640
Just to worm his way out of pain.

733
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,640
Maybe it's time we give him a taste for his own medicine.

734
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,640
Don't you think?

735
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:33,640
Oh.

736
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,640
Well, I hope you're not charging me by the hour, Father.

737
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:39,640
I was just saying to my brother, Mr Biggins, all this talk of Egypt.

738
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:41,640
It's got me thinking.

739
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:43,640
Do you mind if I check one more thing?

740
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:45,640
Oh, I suppose.

741
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,640
Right, come here. Let's have a look at you.

742
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:55,640
Yeah.

743
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:57,640
Just as I suspected.

744
00:39:58,640 --> 00:39:59,640
Nile fever.

745
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:00,640
Oh.

746
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:02,640
Nile what?

747
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:03,640
Fever.

748
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:07,640
It's mainly prevalent in North Africa. I'm fairly certain your goat has it.

749
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:09,640
Well, how?

750
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:11,640
She's never been to Africa.

751
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:14,640
Spittle.

752
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:15,640
Yes.

753
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:16,640
Come again?

754
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,640
On the back of her postage stamp, no doubt.

755
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,640
You're winding me up.

756
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,640
Your son's in the army, isn't he?

757
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:24,640
Yeah, Royal Tank Regiment.

758
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,640
Oh, well, that explains it. It's airborne, you see.

759
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:27,640
Airborne.

760
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:31,640
I'm meant to believe that African Spittle is killing Margot.

761
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:33,640
No, no, no. She's not dying. Far from it.

762
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:35,640
A simple injection should sort her out.

763
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:38,640
I must say, it's a good job you've been using our medicine.

764
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:39,640
How do you mean?

765
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:43,640
Well, if not, the injection could cause serious, serious consequences for the animal.

766
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:45,640
You mean it could kill her?

767
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:46,640
Within seconds.

768
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,640
But you've nothing to worry about. She's had the sulfanilamide.

769
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,640
Oh, no, no. There's been a misunderstanding.

770
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:52,640
What sort of misunderstanding?

771
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:53,640
I just...

772
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:57,640
I just don't think she's been getting enough of the stuff.

773
00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:00,640
Maybe I'll need to increase the dosage.

774
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:05,640
I always find it easier to administer if you take it out of the packet.

775
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:17,640
Are you sure you've got everything?

776
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:20,640
Anyone would think he was trying to get rid of us.

777
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:22,640
Did Mrs. Hall give you some cake?

778
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,640
Enough to see us through till winter.

779
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:28,640
One last cuddle for your granny before we go.

780
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:30,640
Goodbye, sir.

781
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:31,640
Quite soon?

782
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:33,640
Every Sunday without fail.

783
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:36,640
Why do I feel like I'm being ganged up on here?

784
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:37,640
Get used to it.

785
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:56,640
You two seem to be getting on famously now.

786
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:00,640
Maybe we could invite them to stay for the summer.

787
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:02,640
Let's not get carried away.

788
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:11,640
James? Helen?

789
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:18,640
Looks like the party's over.

790
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:23,640
I never got to do my speech.

791
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:29,640
Then do it for me now.

792
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:30,640
Don't be ridiculous.

793
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:32,640
I'm being serious.

794
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:34,640
I want to hear it.

795
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:45,640
Perhaps an abridged version?

796
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:47,640
Music to my ears.

797
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:00,640
I thought I'd start by talking about the Emperor Penguin.

798
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:03,640
That might be where you lose your audience.

799
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:06,640
And how fatherhood takes many forms.

800
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:13,640
But however they manifest,

801
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:17,640
all fathers, God, surrogate or otherwise,

802
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:19,640
share one common desire.

803
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:22,640
To help those under their care become the best version of themselves.

804
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:27,640
Job done.

805
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:35,640
The trouble is, when they start to forge their own path,

806
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:39,640
and you realise the roles have somehow reversed.

807
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:45,640
I don't know what to do.

808
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:47,640
The roles have somehow reversed.

809
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:52,640
You find yourself needing them.

810
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:55,640
Far more than they ever needed you.

811
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:07,640
And then I thought I'd end on a flourish with a particularly person in quote from Aristotle.

812
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:10,640
Why do you always have to go back to the Greeks?

813
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:14,640
I'm sorry if my terms of reference are too highbrow for you.

814
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:16,640
I just think it'd be nice if you chose a book we'd all read.

815
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:18,640
Like what, Tristan? The Dandy?

816
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:23,640
The Greeks built the foundations of Western civilisation?

817
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:25,640
A first class education and this is what you come out with?

818
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:27,640
It beggars belief, it really does.

819
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:29,640
I'm a student of life, not the classroom.

820
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:31,640
It's nice to see those two getting on so well.

821
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:34,640
Isn't it just?
